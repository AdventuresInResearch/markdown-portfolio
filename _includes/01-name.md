# Izabella Sall's Adventures in Research
## What I have learned from my adventures so far:
- Negative data is still data.
- Science is 90% failure and 10% success.
- Always celebrate your victories, no matter how small or large they may be.
- Learn to filter and focus to avoid getting lost down the rabbit hole.
